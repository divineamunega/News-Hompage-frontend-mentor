## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned Css grid just before I started this project and this mini-project helpedme to improve my knowledge on it.I also learned that creating an offcanvas navigation menu is'nt as hard as it looks afterall
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
main{
    width: 100%;
    height: 650px;
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 40px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 3fr 1fr;
    padding: 0 70px;
    margin-top: 30px;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

```
### Continued development

I want to keep learning Css and Plain (vannilla) Js for now ... It amazes me how much i don't know at all
